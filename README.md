Who are you? What is your background?
    My name is Bryn Lloyd-Davies. I graduated from WSU with a degree in accounting and a minor in French. I worked as an accountant for a year and a half before starting a role as a financial analyst for Apptio. I mainly work with revenue forecasting, departmental budget forecasting and planning, foreign currency forecasting, and financial modeling. 

What are your career goals?
    I would like to eventually possibly have a more specialized role with creating models and evaluating decisions based on those models, or potentially working in consulting on automation. Possibly specifically related to acquisitions or foreign currency hedging. 

Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?
    Accounting was boring and I enjoy finance and the broad scope of the work that can be explored but there is a lot that can benefit from incorporating tech into it. For me I get to work in something that comes fairly easily to me (finance) while also challenging myself by learning something less intuitive for me (coding) and using that to complete tasks that I find fulfilling.
